## Centralized network:

- Multiple clients are connected to a single server which stores all the data.
- When a client needs data, he requests to the server for data and then the server responds.
- The main disadvantage is that the data can be hacked easily since data is stored on a single server.

## Distributed P2P network :

- No server is used.
- All the computers in the network are connected to each other.
- So even if anyone computer gets hacked, there is a chance to obtain the required data from some other computer in the network.
- In real world, lakhs of computers are connected in such P2P network, so the hacker will need to hack all the computers at once to takedown the network which is not possible.

## Working of Distributed P2P network in Blockchain :

- Suppose there are 5 miners/computers connected in a P2P n/w and each has its own blockchain.
- One of the miner adds a block to its blockchain.
- Now this data is forwarded to the miners connected to it and on validating data, the miners update their blockchain respectively.

- Distributed P2P network helps in recovering lost data.
