## Why learn Blockchain ? - Reasons :

- Blockchain is a distruptive technology meaning it will change the way we access the internet traditionally by introducing new advanced methods/technology.
- It is more secure and can be trusted.

## What is BlockChain ?

- Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger which is completely transparent.
- Block works as a ledger where our all transactions are noted down or stored and once they are written into the block, no one can change it i.e they are immutable.
- Every transaction made will be updated on all computers connected in the network, thus making the process/transaction transparent.
- Not everyone will be able to see your transaction details, only you as the real owner can see the details as they are encrypted using Cryptography.

## Applications :

- Product Tracking
- Smart Contracts
- International Wire Transfer
- Healthcare system - A patient's data/medical history can be stored in blockchain, so that which ever hospital he goes, his data can be easily accessed instead of again 
  conducting the tests.
